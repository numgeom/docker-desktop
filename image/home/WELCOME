Welcome to the Docker image for the NumGeom development team!

The source code for the old NumGeom is under ~/numgeom, precompiled for Octave
and MATLAB. The modules for NumGeom2 are under ~/numgeom2, which will gradually
replace the implementations in ~/numgeom.

Iterative solvers based on PETSc and ILUPACK are under ~/fastsolve, precompiled
for MATLAB and Octave. These solvers are directly accessible in NumGeom as
functions gmresMILU, gmresHypre, etc.

Please save your code and data in ~/shared, which maps to the current work
directory on your host computer. You can also save them under ~/numgeom,
~/numgeom2 or ~/fastsolve. These folders are preserved unless you restart the
Docker image using the "-c" option.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host computer
has been added to bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in a terminal
within the Docker desktop to add your ssh key to the ssh-agent.

Happy coding!
