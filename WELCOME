Welcome to the Docker image for the NumGeom development team!

The source code for the old NumGeom is under ~/numgeom, precompiled for Octave.
The modules for NumGeom2 are under ~/numgeom2. These gradually replace the
implementations in ~/numgeom.

Iterative solvers based on Petsc and ILUPACK are under the ~/fastsolve
directory, precompiled for MATLAB and Octave. These solvers are directly
accessible in NumGeom as functions gmresMILU, gmresHypre, etc.

Please save your code and data in ~/shared, ~/numgeom, ~/numgeom2, or ~/fastsolve,
or you would lose them after this Docker container exits. The ~/shared directory
maps to the current work directory on your host computer, so you can exchange
data through the directory.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host computer
is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal to add your
ssh key to the ssh-agent.

Happy coding!
